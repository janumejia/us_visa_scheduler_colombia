# üá∫üá∏ US Visa Appointment Rescheduler - Colombia  

This project is an automated bot designed to reschedule U.S. visa appointments on [usvisa-info.com](https://usvisa-info.com). It allows you to **reschedule both the consular and CAS appointments** to a more convenient date and time.  

## üìå Prerequisites  
- You must already have a **scheduled U.S. visa appointment**.  
- [Optional] An **API Token** from **Pushover** and/or **SendGrid** to receive notifications.  
  - You can also use the **esender.php** file in this repository to send email notifications from your website.  

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Information  
- This bot is **adapted for Colombia** and has been successfully tested for rescheduling appointments as of **February 2025**.  
- To use it in other countries, modify the list of supported embassies in the **embassy.py** file.  

### ‚ûï Adding a New Embassy  
To add an embassy, you need to find its **"facility id"** by following these steps:  

1. In **Google Chrome**, go to the appointment booking page in your account.  
2. **Right-click** on the location section and select **"Inspect"**.  
3. A window will open with the HTML code, highlighting a `<select>` element.  
4. Find the **facility id** and add it to the **embassy.py** file.  
5. If multiple embassies have different **facility ids**, you can add them as well.
